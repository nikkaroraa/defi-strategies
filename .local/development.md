# Delta Neutral Strategy Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a delta neutral strategy for neutral market conditions that:
- Accepts USDC deposits
- Converts to ETH for spot exposure
- Opens short ETH perpetual positions
- Earns funding rates + staking/lending yields

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- ✅ Created .local directory structure
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for local files
- ✅ Created core interfaces (IStrategy, IPositionManager, IDeltaNeutralVault)
- ✅ Implemented DeltaNeutralVault contract with ERC20 shares
- ✅ Built PositionManager for delta calculations with Chainlink price feeds
- ✅ Created AaveLendingStrategy for spot yield generation
- ✅ Set up comprehensive test suite with 8 passing tests
- ✅ Resolved stack too deep issue (removed unused AAVE interface function)
- ✅ Created comprehensive Solidity style guide (style-guide.md)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with project standards
- ✅ Updated all contracts to use specific Solidity version (0.8.28)
- ✅ Replaced require statements with custom errors for gas efficiency
- ✅ Added comprehensive NatSpec documentation with lowercase style
- ✅ Renamed DeltaNeutralVault to MarketNeutralVault for clarity
- ✅ Renamed AaveLendingStrategy to AaveStrategy for brevity
- ✅ Updated all interfaces and test files to match new names

### Stack Too Deep Issue - RESOLVED ✅
The issue was NOT with Solmate or our contract design. The problem was the `getReserveData` function in the AAVE V3 interface that returns 15 values, causing stack too deep in the test mocks.

**Root Cause:** IAaveV3Pool.getReserveData returning 15 values
**Solution:** Removed unused getReserveData function from interface
**Result:** Project compiles successfully without via_ir

**Key Takeaway:** Solmate works perfectly fine. When encountering stack too deep, check for:
- Functions returning many values (>10)
- Complex mock implementations in tests
- Unused interface functions that can be removed

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. Create GMX perpetual strategy for short positions
2. Implement DEX integration for USDC->WETH conversions
3. Add rebalancing logic to maintain delta neutrality
4. Implement yield harvesting mechanisms
5. Add more comprehensive testing with fork tests
6. Deploy to testnet for real-world testing
